# To-Do Plugin

An axum-based To-Do plugin, based on OpenAI's To-Do example.

This example provides a template for creating a ChatGPT plugin in Rust. The plugin is served with [axum](https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/) and handles database interactions with [sea-orm](https://docs.rs/sea-orm/0.11.3/sea_orm/).

This example is still incomplete, as I don't currently have plugin access. It may remain incomplete because I intend to use it primarily for my own GPT-4 frontend.
